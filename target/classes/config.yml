#             Thank you for using GraveBox by Bebo!                 #
# =================================================================== #

# Grave Settings
# Configure the appearance, size, and behavior of graves.
grave:
  # Material to use for graves. Use standard Bukkit Material names.
  # Common options: CHEST, BARREL, SHULKER_BOX, ENDER_CHEST
  material: "CHEST"

  # Size of the grave inventory.
  # This setting determines the number of slots in the grave.
  # Options:
  # - "SMALL": 9 slots (one row)
  # - "MEDIUM": 18 slots (two rows)
  # - "LARGE": 27 slots (standard single chest/barrel/shulker)
  # - "EXTRA_LARGE": 54 slots (standard double chest)
  #
  # IMPORTANT NOTE FOR 'EXTRA_LARGE':
  # - If 'material' is CHEST, the plugin will try to place a DOUBLE CHEST.
  #   This requires an empty air block next to the death location.
  # - If no space is available, it will fall back to a single 27-slot chest.
  # - Other materials (like BARREL) cannot be 54 slots and will be capped at 27.
