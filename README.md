# GraveBox

GraveBox is a robust Minecraft plugin designed to enhance player experience by preventing item loss upon death. Instead of dropping items when players die, GraveBox automatically creates a special container (grave) at the death location that securely stores all inventory items.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Grave Creation:** Instantly generates a container at the exact death location when a player dies.
- **Complete Inventory Preservation:** Transfers all inventory items (including armor and offhand) to the grave container.
- **Multiple Container Options:** Supports various container types configurable via settings.
- **Smart Grave Management:** Automatically removes empty graves to prevent clutter.

### Protection Systems
- **Explosion Protection:** Option to protect graves from being destroyed by explosions (TNT, creepers, etc.).
- **Indestructible Graves:** Configurable option to make graves immune to all destruction attempts.
- **Owner-Exclusive Access:** Only the deceased player can access their own grave.

### Customization Options
- **Custom Grave Names:** Supports personalized grave names with player name placeholders.
- **Flexible Material Choices:** Configure which block type to use for graves (chest, barrel, etc.).
- **Item Drop Control:** Choose whether destroyed graves should drop their contents.

### User Experience
- **Death Location Notification:** Players receive coordinates of their grave location.
- **Clear Messaging:** Customizable messages for all grave interactions.
- **Visual Banner:** Eye-catching console banner upon plugin activation.

## Installation Guide

1. Download the latest `GraveBox.jar` from the official source.
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins/` directory.

4. Configure settings in `plugins/GraveBox/config.yml` as needed.
5. Reload the plugin or restart the server to apply changes.

## Detailed Configuration Options

The `config.yml` file contains the following customizable settings:

### Grave Settings
