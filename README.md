# 🪦 GraveBox v2.1.2

GraveBox is a robust Minecraft plugin designed to enhance player experience by preventing item loss upon death. Instead of dropping items when players die, GraveBox automatically creates a special container (grave) at the death location that securely stores all inventory items.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Core Functionality
- **🪦 Automatic Grave Creation:** Instantly generates a container at the exact death location when a player dies
- **🎒 Complete Inventory Preservation:** Transfers ALL items including:
  - Full armor set (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
  - Offhand items (shields, totems, etc.)
  - Main inventory contents
  - Hotbar items
- **📦 Multiple Container Options:** Supports CHEST, BARREL, and SHULKER_BOX
- **🧹 Smart Grave Management:** Automatically removes empty graves to prevent clutter
- **📂 File-based Storage:** Each grave's contents are saved to individual YML files
- **🔍 Virtual Inventory Mode:** Uses virtual inventories for grave contents
- **🧭 Grave HUD system for locating graves** (Added by [@owenparry-pb](https://github.com/owenparry-pb) - 2025-08-12)

- ### New HUD Feature 🧭

The Grave HUD feature (added 2025-08-12 21:23:57) helps players locate their graves using a boss bar display that shows:
- 🎯 Directions to the nearest grave using arrows
- 📏 Distance in meters
- 🧭 Compass direction
- 📊 Progress bar that decreases as you get further from the grave

The HUD updates in real-time and works across all worlds, showing appropriate messages when graves are in different dimensions:
- ❌ "No graves found" - When you have no graves
- 🌐 "Graves found in other dimensions" - When your graves are in a different dimension
- 🚫 "No graves found in this dimension" - When no graves are in your current dimension
- 📍 "Grave too far away (Xm)" - When the grave is beyond tracking distance

### Compass Direction Guide 🧭
```
             N (⬆)
    NW (⬉)   |   NE (⬈)
              |
W (⬅) -------|-------- E (➡)
              |
    SW (⬋)   |   SE (⬊)
             S (⬇)
```

### Using the HUD

1. Type `/gravehud` to toggle the HUD on/off
